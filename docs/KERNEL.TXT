Here's a table outlining the different ways of entering the kernel:

### **Methods of Entering the Kernel**


| **Hardware Interrupts** | 
    Triggered by external devices or internal events, requiring the kernel to handle them. 
    | Keyboard input, timer interrupts, network packet arrival. |

| **Software Interrupts** | 
    Generated by software to request kernel services, commonly via system calls. 
    | `int 0x80` in x86 for Linux system calls, `syscall` instruction in x86-64. |

| **Jumps (jmp)** | 
    Directly transfers execution control to a new memory location without saving return info. 
    | A bootloader `jmp` instruction jumping to the kernel entry point. |

| **Calls (call)** | 
    Transfers control to a new function while saving return address for later. 
    | A ring 0 kernel module calling an exported kernel function. |

other ?:

Exceptions & Faults – 
The CPU automatically enters the kernel when an exception or fault occurs (e.g., page faults, divide-by-zero errors).

System Management Mode (SMM) Entrypoints – 
Special low-level entry points triggered by firmware for system-critical operations, often hidden from the OS.

Hypervisor Calls (VM Exits) – 
When running in a virtualized environment, guest kernels enter the hypervisor via VM exits or hypercalls.

========================================================

### **Kernel Overview**  
- The kernel primarily **manages devices** and **manages processes**, forming the foundation of an operating system.  

### **Kernel Responsibilities**  
- **Device Management:** Handling drivers, I/O operations, peripheral control, power management, etc.  
- **Process Management:** Scheduling, memory allocation, inter-process communication (IPC), security, etc.  

### **Kernel Entry Points**  
- **Hardware interrupts** (e.g., keyboard input, timer events).  
- **Software interrupts** (e.g., system calls using `int 0x80` or `syscall`).  
- **Jumps (`jmp`)** for direct execution transfers (e.g., bootloader jumps to the kernel).  
- **Calls (`call`)** for controlled execution transfer (e.g., kernel module calling exported functions).  

### **Kernel Initialization**  
- Starts with **assembly code** for basic CPU setup (registers, paging, stack, interrupts).  
- Transitions to **C code**, initializing devices and performing deeper CPU configuration.  
- Early tasks include **memory setup, device enumeration, interrupt handling, and scheduling activation**.  

### **Filesystem Perspective**  
- Filesystem management is a form of **device management**, mainly interacting with block storage.  
- Some filesystems operate virtually (e.g., tmpfs), showing software abstraction over hardware handling.  

### **Kernel Exception Handling**  
- **Exceptions and faults** (e.g., page faults, divide-by-zero) are a subset of **interrupts**.  
- The kernel must handle these to ensure system stability and security.
