 Personality as environment subsystem distinctions and syscalls.

 GUI Environment and Non‑GUI Environment

daemons, ring 3 drivers, ring 3 servers can be part of the posix personality easily.
By keeping daemons, drivers, and servers under the POSIX personality, 
you avoid fragmenting the model.

==================================================

Syscalls:
My kernel is POSIX‑focused. Both POSIX‑style applications and GUI applications 
use the same POSIX‑lite kernel services. The GUI stack builds on top 
of these services, so even graphical apps interact with the kernel 
through the POSIX API.

This is actually very similar to how Linux + X11/Wayland works: 
the kernel provides POSIX syscalls, and GUI apps still 
use them (for files, sockets, IPC), while graphical requests go through a 
user‑space display server.

============================================
**personality model** is really about distinguishing between two broad environments:  

---

### GUI Environment
- **Who belongs here:**  
  - Display server (once it registers itself).  
  - Client‑side graphical applications (windowed apps, desktop tools).  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Needs IPC with the display server.  
  - Often requires responsiveness and event‑driven scheduling.  
  - Security concerns: GUI apps may handle user input, so they need sandboxing to avoid leaking sensitive data.  
- **Personality tag:** `PERSONALITY_GUI`.

---

### Non‑GUI Environment
- **Who belongs here:**  
  - Init process.  
  - POSIX command‑line tools, daemons, background services.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Uses standard POSIX syscalls (file I/O, fork/exec, signals).  
  - Typically text‑based or headless.  
  - Security concerns: daemons may need privileges but don’t interact with the display server.  
- **Personality tag:** `PERSONALITY_POSIX`.
