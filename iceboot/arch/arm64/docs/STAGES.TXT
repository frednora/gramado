Where you are in the bigger ARM picture

Reset vector (ROM code): Already executed by the SoC.
Your _start: First-stage bootloader, running in AArch64 privileged mode.
Hardware init: You’re beginning this (UART init). Next steps would be DRAM, timers, etc.
Second-stage bootloader: Typically loads kernel image into memory.
Kernel (EL1): OS takes over, sets up virtual memory, drivers, etc.
User space (EL0): Applications finally run here.
