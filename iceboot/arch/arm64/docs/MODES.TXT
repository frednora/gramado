ARM doesn’t have the same staged transition 
that x86 does (16‑bit real mode → 32‑bit protected mode → 64‑bit long mode).

AArch32 (32-bit state):
  User mode: least privileged, for applications.
  System mode: privileged, similar to kernel mode.
  Supervisor (SVC) mode: for OS calls.
  IRQ/FIQ modes: for handling interrupts.
  Abort/Undefined modes: for exceptions.
  Monitor mode: for TrustZone secure world switching.

AArch64 (64-bit state):
  EL0: User applications.
  EL1: Operating system kernel.
  EL2: Hypervisor (virtualization).
  EL3: Secure monitor (firmware, TrustZone).

----------------------------------
ARM
  Starts in reset state (depends on SoC: either AArch32 or AArch64)
  No “real mode” → directly runs in whichever execution state the hardware is configured for.
  If CPU supports AArch64, firmware can boot directly into 64‑bit (EL1/EL2/EL3)
  No mandatory sequence — the CPU can start in 32‑bit or 64‑bit depending on design

------------------------------------
ARM Boot Flow
Reset: CPU begins at a fixed reset vector.
Execution state:
  On older ARM cores → starts in AArch32 (32‑bit).
  On modern ARMv8+ cores → can start directly in AArch64 (64‑bit).
Firmware/boot ROM: Initializes hardware.
Bootloader (U‑Boot, UEFI, etc.): Loads the kernel.
OS kernel: Runs in EL1 (privileged), applications in EL0.
