EBDA is the BIOS data area
Inside this region we can find the MP Table and the RSDP root table.
All the ACPI tables are outside the EBDA region.

The **Extended BIOS Data Area (EBDA)** is a reserved memory region in the lower system memory, 
typically located near the **640 KB mark**. It's often used to store firmware-related information, 
such as the **MultiProcessor (MP) Table** and the **Root System Description Pointer (RSDP)**.

However, as you correctly pointed out, **the rest of the ACPI tables**—like the **RSDT/XSDT**, **DSDT**, 
and others—are located outside the EBDA. They reside in system memory, where the operating system 
can access them after booting. The firmware initializes and maps them into these regions, 
ensuring proper hardware configuration and power management.

It sounds like you're deep into system-level memory mapping—are you developing or 
researching ACPI table parsing?
