Intel:
1. VMLAUNCH / VMRESUME (Enter a Virtual Machine)
2. VMEXIT (Exit a Virtual Machine)

VMLAUNCH: 
Initiates a virtual machine (VM) by transitioning from the host (your hypervisor/kernel) 
to the guest (the VM’s code) for the first time. It loads the guest’s state from 
a VMCS (Virtual Machine Control Structure) and starts execution.

VMRESUME: 
Resumes a previously interrupted VM (after a VMEXIT) by restoring the guest’s state 
from the VMCS. It’s used for subsequent entries into the same VM.

VMEXIT: 
Automatically transfers control from the guest VM back to the host (your hypervisor/kernel) 
when specific events occur, as defined in the VMCS. These events include interrupts, 
privileged instructions (e.g., CPUID, HLT), I/O operations, or page faults, 
depending on VMCS settings.
