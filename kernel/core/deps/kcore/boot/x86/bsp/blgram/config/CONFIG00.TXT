Great question! This is an important and subtle part of bootloader and low-level disk driver design.

## **Understanding "Boot Port" Selection**

### 1. **What the Configuration Does**
Your configuration file statically selects a port (e.g., Primary/Master) at build time:
```c
#define __CONFIG_DEFAULT_ATA_PORT __BAR0 // Primary, master
```
This tells your bootloader:  
**"When reading the kernel image (or any file), use this port as the source disk."**

---

### 2. **Why This Can Be Limiting**
- If the BIOS boots from a different disk (say, secondary master or a slave device), your hardcoded setting may not match the device the BIOS actually booted from.
- In multi-disk systems (or virtual machines with several disks), this could cause the bootloader to look for the kernel in the wrong place.

---

### 3. **How BIOS Boot Actually Works**
- **BIOS loads the boot sector from the boot device it selected**—this device is usually mapped as "Drive 0x80" (the first hard disk) in BIOS INT 13h services.
- The bootloader is loaded from this disk, but at this point, it doesn’t necessarily know if it was the primary master or another device.
- The bootloader, when switching to protected mode and direct ATA access, **must figure out which ATA port (and which master/slave) corresponds to the device BIOS used**.

---

### 4. **How Professional Bootloaders Solve It**
- **Some bootloaders query the BIOS (via INT 13h) to get the drive number (0x80 = first HD, 0x81 = second, etc).**
- When switching to protected mode/ATA, they may probe all ports and try to match the disk signature (e.g., by reading the MBR and checking for a unique value).
- Some BIOSes provide drive geometry info or device mapping in memory (e.g., at 0x475), but this is not always reliable.

---

### 5. **What You Can Do in Your Bootloader**
**Best Practice:**
1. **At startup, scan all 4 ports (primary/secondary, master/slave).**
2. **For each, try to read the MBR or a known sector.**
3. **Check for a "boot signature" or look for the expected partition table.**
4. **Once you find the matching disk, use that port for all subsequent reads.**

**Alternative:**
- If you want to keep things simple, require the user (or VM config) to always boot from the primary master, but this limits flexibility.

### 6. **Sample Pseudocode for Boot Port Detection**
```c
int detected_boot_port = -1;
for (int port = 0; port < 4; port++) {
    if (probe_ata_device(port)) {
        if (disk_has_valid_boot_sector(port)) {
            detected_boot_port = port;
            break;
        }
    }
}
if (detected_boot_port == -1) {
    // No valid boot device found!
}
```
- `probe_ata_device(port)` checks if a device is present/ready.
- `disk_has_valid_boot_sector(port)` reads sector 0 and checks for 0x55AA signature and a valid partition table.

---

## **Summary**

- Relying solely on a static configuration works for simple setups but is fragile.
- For robust booting on any port, **probe all ports at boot time** and use the one with a valid boot sector or matching disk signature.
- This approach is used by professional bootloaders and operating systems for maximum compatibility.
