-----------------------------------------------------
 drivers/
 All the apps here runs in KERNEL CONSOLE SUBSYSTEM.

-----------------------------------------------------
 servers/
 All the apps here runs in KERNEL CONSOLE SUBSYSTEM.

-----------------------------------------------------
 
 All the apps here runs in KERNEL CONSOLE SUBSYSTEM.
 > But some applications runs in different subsystem, 
just like pubsh.bin that runs in PUBTERM SUBSYSTEM.
 > shell.bin is also able to send data to the terminal.bin 
when terminal.bin types start-shell. In this case, shell is 
running in the TERMINAL SUBSYSTEM.
