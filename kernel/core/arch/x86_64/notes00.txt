1. Folder Contents & Code Structure

The folder contains core kernel initialization and interrupt handler code, 
including files like head_64.asm, x86_64.asm, pic.asm, pit.asm, and others. 

Both head_64.asm and x86_64.asm contain the logic for setting up 
the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) and initializing handlers for CPU 
exceptions and hardware IRQs.
