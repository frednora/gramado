Singularity by Copilot

Inside the ballerina’s heart   
a singularity of motion,  
where gravity bends to her will,  
where rhythm collapses into eternity.  

Time fractures beneath her pirouettes,  
spinning endlessly into the void,  
each pulse a fusion of beauty and force,  
each leap defying the weight of existence.  

She is the event horizon—  
a threshold of untamed grace,  
beyond which the world dissolves,  
lost in the pull of her dance.  

No light escapes, no past remains—  
only movement, infinite and unfathomable,  
the quiet mystery of a soul suspended  
inside its own collapsing star.
