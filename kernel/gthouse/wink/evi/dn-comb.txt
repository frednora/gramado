System-Wide Keyboard Shortcuts Handled 
by the Kernel Input BrokerHere is a complete list of key combinations 
processed directly by the kernel (in ibroker.c). 
These shortcuts work at any time, 
even if the GUI is unresponsive.

Ctrl + F2   → Launch editor application
Ctrl + F3   → Launch document viewer application
Ctrl + F4   → Launch public terminal application
Ctrl + F9   → Enter the embedded kernel console (ring-0 shell)
Ctrl + F10  → Exit the embedded kernel console
Ctrl + F11  → Show thread list (show_slots())
Ctrl + F12  → Show process information
Shift + F1  → Switch to virtual console 0
Shift + F2  → Switch to virtual console 1

These combinations are intercepted by the kernel before reaching applications, 
ensuring system control and recovery options are always available.
