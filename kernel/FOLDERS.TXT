Roles
core/:    The “brain” of the kernel. Manages execution, scheduling, and orchestrates resources.
include/: Kernel headers, shared definitions, and exported symbols.
libk/:    Low-level runtime library for privileged (ring 0) operations.
res/:     Concrete resource implementations (devices, filesystems, memory, networking).
wink/:    User interaction layer — event interface (EVI), graphics device interface (GDI), and user subsystem.

---------------------------------------------
Core Subsystem (core/)
core/
 ├── arch/   → Architecture-specific assembly code
 ├── ke/     → HAL, dispatcher, scheduler
 └── kwrap/  → Syscall interface, namespaces, cgroups, virtualization, panic/reboot

arch/:  Hardware‑specific assembly routines (bootstrapping, context switching).
ke/:    Kernel executive — abstracts hardware, manages threads, scheduling, interrupts.
kwrap/: Top‑layer wrapper — syscall entry points, namespace/cgroup management, virtualization hooks, panic/reboot handling.

---------------------------------------------
Resource Subsystem (res/)
res/
 ├── bus/   → System buses and interconnects
 ├── dev/   → Device drivers (block, char, net)
 ├── fs/    → Filesystem implementations
 ├── mm/    → Memory management
 └── net/   → Networking stack

bus/: Abstractions for PCI, USB, and other interconnects.
dev/: Drivers for block devices, character devices, and network devices.
fs/:  Filesystem layers (VFS, ext‑like, FAT‑like, etc.).
mm/:  Memory allocation, paging, virtual memory.
net/: Protocol stack, sockets, routing.

---------------------------------------------
Other Components

include/:
  Kernel headers, macros, type definitions.
  Provides the interface between subsystems.

libk/:
  Runtime library for ring 0.
  Utility functions, string/memory ops, math, debugging helpers.

wink/:
  EVI (Event Interface): Event handling between kernel and user space.
  GDI (Graphics Device Interface): Graphics abstraction for user applications.
  User: User‑mode interaction layer, possibly windowing or input handling.
