Kernel Folder Organization
--------------------------

The kernel source tree is organized into three main areas: the Gatehouse, the Halls, and the Library. 
This structure is designed to make the entry points, management responsibilities, and shared definitions 
clear and easy to navigate.

1. gthouse/ (Gatehouse)
   - Contains all code related to entering the kernel.
   - Responsibilities:
     * Entry point and initialization routines
     * Syscall and interrupt stubs
     * High-level kernel wrappers
     * Shared kernel library (libk)
     * User interface layer (input events and GDI)
   - Subfolders:
     * arch/   : Architecture-specific boot code and interrupt stubs
     * kwrap/  : Kernel wrappers and abstractions
     * libk/   : Shared kernel utilities
     * wink/   : User interface handling (input + graphics)

2. halls/ (Castle Halls)
   - Contains the main management units of the kernel.
   - Responsibilities are divided into three halls:
     * exec/ (CPU Hall)    : Thread management, dispatcher, scheduler, exceptions
     * req/  (Memory Hall) : Syscalls and memory management (mm/)
     * per/  (IRQ Hall)    : Peripheral devices and interrupt handling

3. include/ (Castle Library)
   - Contains headers and shared definitions used across the kernel.
   - Provides the common interfaces and constants that bind the system together.

Summary:
--------
- All entry paths into the kernel (boot, syscalls, IRQs, ring 0 calls) converge in gthouse/.
- All management responsibilities are handled inside the appropriate hall (exec, req, per).
- All shared definitions and interfaces are stored in include/.
