
 Posix Subsystem for Gramado.

 The kernel handles the keyboard input using system messages,
normally sent to the display server's thread. 

#todo:
 >>> We need to create a Posix Subsystem for Gramado, where
we will send keyboard input to the applications that are running 
inside a virtual terminal and reading input via stdin.

#todo:
  We need a compatibility layer. First the input goes to the gramado input system 
and then it goes to the compatibility layer to serve some app running inside the terminal.
It needs to respect the configuration found in the compatibility layer.
