 Buffers used by e1000 Intel NIC device driver:

-------------------------------------
Set 1 – Hardware/DMA Descriptors

legacy_rx_descs[]  
The receive descriptor ring. 
Each entry holds the physical address of an RX buffer, its length, and status bits. 
The NIC hardware uses this to DMA incoming frames.

legacy_tx_descs[]  
The transmit descriptor ring. 
Each entry holds the physical address of a TX buffer, its length, and 
control/status bits. The NIC hardware uses this to DMA outgoing frames.

-------------------------------------
Set 2 – Kernel/Driver Virtual Buffers

rx_buffers_virt[]  
Array of virtual addresses mapped to the RX buffers. 
The kernel/driver uses these pointers to access the contents of received frames 
after the NIC has filled them.

tx_buffers_virt[]  
Array of virtual addresses mapped to the TX buffers. 
The kernel/driver writes outgoing frame data here 
before handing it off to the NIC via the transmit descriptors.

-------------------------------------
#ps:

rx_buffers_virt and tx_buffers_virt are the ring buffers ... 
the place where the NIC puts the data via DMA

rx_buffers_virt[]  
This is the receive ring buffer in virtual memory.

tx_buffers_virt[]  
This is the transmit ring buffer in virtual memory.

-------------------------------------
So in short:

Descriptors (legacy_rx_descs, legacy_tx_descs):
    hardware-facing, physical addresses for DMA.

Buffers (rx_buffers_virt, tx_buffers_virt):
   software-facing, virtual addresses for the kernel to read/write frame data.

-------------------------------------
You we have:

Hardware/DMA descriptors (legacy_rx_descs, legacy_tx_descs):
    physical addresses, status bits, used by the NIC engine.

Kernel/driver virtual buffers (rx_buffers_virt, tx_buffers_virt):
   virtual addresses, used by your kernel to actually read/write frame data.
