 Consider the following perspective, for organization purpose:

 IDT Castle Perspective: (Interrupt-Centric View)
(Interrupt Domains in Sequence)
 + exec - CPU
 + per  - Peripherals
 + req  - Memory

BUS Perspective: (Device Group View)
(Device Groups in Sequence)
(chronological journey through computing history)
(spatial journey from the inside of the machine outward to the user’s world)
 + cpu bus    - (Theoretically)
 + memory bus - (DDR) 
 + legacy bus - (ISA, LPC, eSPI ...)
 + pci bus 
 + usb bus
