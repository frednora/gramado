[ (intake) (dispatcher) (scheduler) ]

[ ]          → the big room (CPU execution arena, the managed space where threads live).
(intake)     → the overarching component, representing the entrance hall where threads are admitted.
(dispatcher) → the door/guard, handling entry and exit (task switch, spawn, context save/restore).
(scheduler)  → the dark room inside, rearranging lists and deciding the order of execution.

Intake (Entrance Hall)
The intake hall is where bandits (threads) are captured and processed before entering the building.
It’s the gateway: threads arrive here, are checked, and either admitted or released.
Intake = the subsystem that controls admission into execution.
