Here’s a polished **skeleton documentation** you can use as a foundation for your kernel project. 
It’s structured like a `README.md` or architecture doc, focusing only 
on the **folders and their purpose** — clean, concise, and developer‑friendly:

# Kernel Project Structure

This document outlines the high‑level directory layout of the kernel and the purpose of each component.

---

## Top-Level Directories

```
kernel/
 ├── core/     → Resource manager (execution, orchestration)
 ├── include/  → Header files (public kernel interfaces)
 ├── libk/     → Runtime library for ring 0
 ├── res/      → Resource subsystems (devices, memory, FS, networking)
 └── wink/     → User-facing interfaces (events, graphics, user API)
```

- **`core/`**  
  Contains the kernel’s execution and orchestration logic. Manages resources defined in `res/`.

- **`include/`**  
  Kernel header files, type definitions, macros, and exported interfaces.

- **`libk/`**  
  Runtime library for ring 0. Provides low-level utilities (string/memory ops, math, helpers).

- **`res/`**  
  Resource subsystems: devices, filesystems, memory, networking. Implements the actual resources managed by `core/`.

- **`wink/`**  
  User interaction layer. Provides event interface (EVI), graphics device interface (GDI), and user subsystem.

---

## Core Subsystem (`core/`)

```
core/
 ├── arch/   → Architecture-specific assembly code
 ├── ke/     → HAL, dispatcher, scheduler
 └── kwrap/  → Syscall interface, namespaces, cgroups, virtualization, panic/reboot
```

- **`arch/`**  
  Hardware‑specific assembly routines (bootstrapping, context switching).

- **`ke/`**  
  Kernel executive. Abstracts hardware, manages threads, scheduling, and interrupts.

- **`kwrap/`**  
  Top‑layer wrapper. Provides syscall entry points, namespace/cgroup management, virtualization hooks, and error handling (panic/reboot).

---

## Resource Subsystem (`res/`)

```
res/
 ├── bus/   → System buses and interconnects
 ├── dev/   → Device drivers (block, char, net)
 ├── fs/    → Filesystem implementations
 ├── mm/    → Memory management
 └── net/   → Networking stack
```

- **`bus/`**  
  Abstractions for system interconnects (PCI, USB, etc.).

- **`dev/`**  
  Device drivers: block devices, character devices, and network devices.

- **`fs/`**  
  Filesystem layers and implementations.

- **`mm/`**  
  Memory management: allocation, paging, virtual memory.

- **`net/`**  
  Networking protocols, sockets, and routing.

---

## User Interface Layer (`wink/`)

- **EVI (Event Interface)**  
  Event handling between kernel and user space.  

- **GDI (Graphics Device Interface)**  
  Graphics abstraction for user applications.  

- **User**  
  User‑mode interaction layer (windowing, input handling, etc.).

---

## Support Infrastructure

- **`include/`**  
  Shared headers and exported kernel interfaces.  

- **`libk/`**  
  Ring 0 runtime library with utility functions for kernel subsystems.  

---

This skeleton serves as the **map of the kernel project**, 
helping developers quickly identify where each subsystem lives and its purpose.
