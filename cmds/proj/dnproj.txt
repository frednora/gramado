Notes on projecton:

  y/r = sin(angle)
  x/r = cos(angle) 
  y = r * sin(angle)
  x = r * cos(angle)

=============================
Using radius=1

  y/1 = sin(angle)
  x/1 = cos(angle) 
  y = 1 * sin(angle)
  x = 1 * cos(angle)

=============================
We have a point (x, y, z)

Projection is related with the correlation:
x' = x/z
y' = y/z

Projection from 3D space (x, y, z) onto a 
2D plane using what’s called perspective projection.

In perspective projection, the farther away 
the point (larger z), the smaller its projected coordinates.

x' = x/z
y' = y/z

Both the unit circle trigonometry and the 3D-to-2D projection rely on the same geometric principle: ratios of lengths relative to a reference distance.

In both cases, the actual coordinates are normalized by a reference measure:
 + Circle: normalized by radius r.
 + Projection: normalized by depth z.

This normalization produces dimensionless ratios (sine, cosine, or projected coordinates) that describe geometry in a simplified way.

==============
Aspect Ratio 

AR = width/height

x' = x/(z*AR)
y' = y/z

If AR > 1 (wide screen), x' is compressed horizontally.
If AR < 1 (tall screen), x' is stretched horizontally.
