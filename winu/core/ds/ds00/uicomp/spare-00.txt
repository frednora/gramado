ROADMAP: Spare Buffer Handling in comp.c
----------------------------------------

1. setup_spare_buffer_clip(width, height, bpp, base)
   - Initializes the SpareBufferClipInfo structure.
   - Sets dimensions, pitch, base pointer, and marks it as initialized.
   - Foundation for clipping and pixel operations in the spare buffer.

2. comp_create_slab_spare_128kb_buffer(size_in_kb)
   - Allocates a region at the end of the backbuffer (spare area).
   - Checks if requested size fits into spare space.
   - Sets up SpareBufferClipInfo for this region.
   - Returns pointer to the spare buffer or NULL if insufficient space.

3. compCreateCanvasUsingSpareBuffer()
   - Creates a small test canvas using the spare buffer.
   - Stores pointer globally in spare_128kb_buffer_p.
   - Optionally draws a test pattern into the buffer for validation.

4. spare_putpixel0(color, x, y, rop)
   - Draws a pixel into the spare buffer with clipping checks.
   - Ensures coordinates are within width/height.
   - Uses putpixel0 with SpareBufferClipInfo.base as target.

5. comp_draw_into_spare_buffer()
   - Test routine to draw a few pixels into the spare buffer.
   - Demonstrates clipping and pixel placement.
   - Useful for validating spare buffer drawing logic.

6. comp_test_spare_buffer()
   - Copies bytes from spare buffer into the backbuffer (top-left corner).
   - Simple byte-by-byte copy for testing.
   - Confirms that spare buffer content can be transferred to visible area.

7. comp_blit_spare_to_backbuffer(dst_x, dst_y, width, height)
   - Blits a rectangle from spare buffer (source at 0,0) into backbuffer at given coordinates.
   - Uses __refresh_rectangle1 for efficient block copy.
   - More advanced than comp_test_spare_buffer (supports arbitrary destination).

8. Integration in comp_display_desktop_components()
   - Calls comp_blit_spare_to_backbuffer as a test (e.g., blitting 10x10 block at 100,100).
   - Refreshes rectangle to show spare buffer content on screen.
   - Demonstrates how spare buffer can be composed into final frame.

----------------------------------------
FUTURE USE:
- Each window can have its own offscreen buffer (like the spare buffer).
- Compositor will blend these buffers into the backbuffer based on z-order.
- Enables transparency, animations, and per-window redraw without touching global backbuffer.
