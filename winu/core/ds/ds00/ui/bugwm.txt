 Description:
 But now you’re pointing out a second layer: when the client app itself 
 resizes or repositions its child controls in response to a paint message, 
 the server side may not be recomputing the children’s absolute bounds consistently. 
 That mismatch will break hit‑testing again, especially for editboxes that grow/shrink.

 When we update the window we also need to update the client area rectangle 
 properlly before sending the paint message

 it means the first maximize path isn’t finishing all the geometry updates, 
 but the second maximize click forces a full recompute, so everything lines up and 
 hit testing works.
