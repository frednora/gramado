#todo: 
Draw into a canvas and let another process put the content
inside the client area of regular client-side GUI application.

We have a 3D demo drawing into the backbuffer now, but in the future 
the rendering can be redirected into an offscreen canvas. This offscreen canvas 
will act as a separate memory buffer where complex graphics are drawn. 
Another process, such as the compositor or a GUI application, will then 
be able to embed this canvas inside the client area of a regular window. 

This approach allows us to keep the window system safe and isolated, 
while still enabling powerful rendering routines for demos, games, or 
even browser engines.
