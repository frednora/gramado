------------------------------------
ACPI table: (QEMU)
In this case we found the RSDP table, that has an element containing the 
physical address of RSDT table. We're mappint this address to virtual address,
but we cant find the signature in RSDT table present in this virtual address.
Possibly the mapping routin fails or we need to refresh rs3 or something.

Floating MP table: (QEMU)
The parsing routine is working fine. We found 20 entries,
one entry is a processor. (BSP)
