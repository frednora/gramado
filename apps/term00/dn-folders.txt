//
// Project structure overview
//
// The project is organized into three main folders,
// each with a clear and distinct responsibility:
//
// 1) shared/
//    Contains global state, shared data structures,
//    and common definitions used by both the UI and the core.
//
// 2) core/
//    Implements the backend logic of the terminal,
//    including command execution, shell behavior,
//    system interaction, and non‑UI processing.
//
// 3) ui/
//    Contains all frontend and rendering code,
//    including drawing routines, window management,
//    cursor handling, and visual presentation.
//
// This separation keeps the architecture modular,
// avoids circular dependencies, and makes the codebase
// easier to maintain and evolve.
