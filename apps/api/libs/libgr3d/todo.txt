 We are creating a 3D library for the client-side GUI applications for Gramado OS.
 Our starting point is getting the routines already implemented into 
 the 3D demos for Gramado OS.

 The goal here is getting the routines found in the 3D demos for Gramado 
and porting them here. This way, the routines can be used by the 
client-side GUI applications.
 There are structures, primitives and other routines that can be useful 
in this library. 

We're gonna need:
 + The structures for the vectors.
 + Matrix operations.
 + The primitive routines.
 + Some other complex routines found in the demos.
 + The triangle rasterization routines. (2D)
 + The support to load and interpret the file
   that contain the model. (The vectors for the model)
+ ... Well, get everything that can be reused.
