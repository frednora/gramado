 Who has the authority to change the forground thread, the one that has 
the permission to get keyboard input?

In graphical environment the authority is the window manager.
In Gramado OS, the window manager is embedded into the display server,
so, this way the authority is the display server.

In CLI/headless environment the authority needs to be the terminal emulator or the shell.
In Gramado OS, this is a work in progress.

#todo
We are still working on the permissions to change the forground thread,
using a kernel structure for input authority. This structure will control 
what is the the process that can change the foreground thread.
