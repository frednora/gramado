>>>> Process name into the process structure is failing when calling the clone function. <<<<

When the init process call the 'clone' syscall to launch the child,
something mess up the process name in the process structure.
Tracking the issue we realized that the problem first happens 
when we call alloc_memory_for_image_and_stack() that will call allocPages() 
during the clone function.
At this time the clone routine is trying to create the stack for the 
child process.
ps: 
There is a lot of hardcoded routines that needs a stack with 32KB,
>>> We can't simply change this size.
But at some way, changing the size can solve the problem?

We still do not have a solution for that.

again:
kernel: Working to find a way to fix an issue in the process name in the process structure.
When the Init Process try to launch the child using the clone syscall something
is messing up the process name in the structure.
It happens when the clone routine if truing to allocate memory for the stack.
Maybe the problem is in the allocator. Maybe it works with another size for the stack,
and it is a huge problem, we cant change it now.
