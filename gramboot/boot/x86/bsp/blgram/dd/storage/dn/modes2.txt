Controller modes

AHCI (Advanced Host Controller Interface):
+ Purpose
  A standard for SATA host controllers that defines a register-level interface 
  for software to communicate with SATA devices.
+ Interface handled	
  Designed exclusively for the SATA interface, 
  allowing full use of its capabilities.
+ Performance
  Higher performance than ATA mode, especially with multiple I/O requests.
+ Features
 Supports modern SATA features like:
 - Native Command Queuing (NCQ): 
   Optimizes the order of read/write commands to increase performance.
 - Hot Swapping: Allows drives to be connected and disconnected while the system is running.
 - TRIM support for SSDs.
+ Implementation for OS
  Requires a more modern and specific AHCI driver to enable advanced features.

ATA (Legacy IDE Mode):
+ Purpose
  A legacy mode that emulates the behavior of the older Parallel ATA (PATA) interface 
  for compatibility with legacy hardware and older operating systems.
+ Interface handled	
  Can handle both SATA and PATA interfaces.
  When using an ATA controller with a SATA drive, 
  the controller runs in a compatibility mode, sacrificing performance.
  It is the native mode for PATA (IDE) drives.
+ Performance
  Slower than AHCI mode.
+ Features
  Lacks advanced features like NCQ and hot-swapping.
+ Implementation for OS
  Allows older operating systems to run without SATA-specific drivers.

Interface standards

SATA (Serial ATA): 
This is the modern, faster interface standard for storage devices. 
A host controller in AHCI mode uses the SATA interface to 
its full potential, while a controller in ATA mode 
can only use the SATA interface in a legacy-compatible way.

PATA (Parallel ATA): 
This is the older, slower interface standard. 
A PATA drive is inherently an ATA device and 
can only be accessed via a controller running in ATA mode.
