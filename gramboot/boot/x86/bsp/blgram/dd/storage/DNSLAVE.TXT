Design notes by Copilot.


// #bugbug
// Both master and slave on the same channel (primary or secondary) always 
// use the same command/base port (0x1F0 for primary, 0x170 for secondary).
// The control port (0x3F6 or 0x376) is only for device control (reset, nIEN, etc.), 
// not for read/write/data/status commands.


Key Points for Slave Device Selection (ATA)
The “slave” bit is bit 4 (0x10) in the Device/Head register (0x1F6, i.e., base_port + 6).
For LBA mode:
Bits 7:5 = 1 1 1
Bit 6: LBA (should be 1 for LBA)
Bit 5: Always 1
Bit 4: 0=Master, 1=Slave
Bits 3-0: LBA bits 24-27
After writing Device/Head register, ATA spec requires a 400ns delay (usually 4 status reads).
