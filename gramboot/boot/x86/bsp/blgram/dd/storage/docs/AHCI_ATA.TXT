Controller modes and interfaces standards.

---------------------------------------
Controller modes:
+ AHCI
+ ATA (IDE mode)
  (Before the existence of ATA there was only the IDE controller mode)

---------------------------------------
Interface standards:
+ SATA 
+ PATA (IDE)

---------------------------------------
Controller modes and interfaces:
+ AHCI: Handles only SATA interface.
+ ATA:  Handles SATA and PATA interfaces.
        PATA is also known as IDE.

==============================================================

Your summary is essentially on point. To clarify:

---------------------------------
Controller Modes:
+ AHCI: 
  Exclusively manages SATA devices, providing modern features 
  like Native Command Queuing (NCQ) and hot swapping.
+ ATA (Legacy IDE Mode): 
  Handles both SATA (in compatibility mode) and PATA devices. 
  Historically, before the advent of ATA standards, 
  the only available controller mode was what we now refer to as the IDE mode.

---------------------------------
Interface Standards:
+ SATA: 
  The modern serial interface used by newer drives.
+ PATA (IDE): 
  The older parallel interface standard, often just called IDE.
