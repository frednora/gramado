Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more detailed and beginner-friendly comment for your TODO file, with simpler English and a step-by-step explanation suitable for a Brazilian developer:

```c
// TODO:
// To help the bootloader or the kernel know which disk is the real boot disk,
// we can create a special mark (signature) on the disk during the installation or at first boot.
// For example, after the MBR (Master Boot Record), we can write a unique word or code
// (like "GRAMADO" or a number) into the second sector (LBA 1).
// Later, when the bootloader or the kernel starts, it can read the second sector of each disk
// and look for this mark. If the mark is found, we know this is the correct disk to use for booting.
// This method avoids confusion when there are many disks or when disks are copies of each other.
// Steps:
// 1. During install or first boot, write your chosen signature in sector 2 (LBA 1).
// 2. When booting, read sector 2 (LBA 1) from every disk you find.
// 3. If you find the signature, select this disk as the boot disk.
```

Let me know if you want it even simpler, or if you need the comment in Portuguese as well!
