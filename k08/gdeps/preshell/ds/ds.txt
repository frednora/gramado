ds/ folder:

Here we have the main display server in ds00/ and 
the libraries used by the display server in libs/.

There is no external dependencies. We can build the display server 
only using it's own libraries found in libs/.

---------------------------------
Why?
Why do we have a lot of different versions of the libc 
in usermode. R: Because it's good for the kernel. In this case 
the kernel is experiencing the scenario where different libc's are 
trying to access the kernel.
